### **4. Layout Considerations**

- **Layout Proportions:**
  - **Forms:** 80% of the page layout should be dedicated to the forms, where the reviewer can fill out and submit their reviews.
  - **Documents:** 20% of the page layout should display the list of documents associated with the protocol, depending on the tab being viewed.
