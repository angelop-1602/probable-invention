### **Recommendations for Proponent Landing Page**  
1. **Visual Progress Tracker**:  
   - Use a color-coded bar showing stages (SC → IR → RS → AP → PR → FR → AR).  
   - Include status acronyms (e.g., "IR: Initial Review") with tooltips for clarity.  

2. **Application Code Input Box**:  
   - Place a prominent "Track Your Application" section at the top with a field to enter the Application Code.  

3. **Document Library**:  
   - Provide downloadable templates (e.g., Form 07A, 07B) and submission guidelines.  

4. **FAQs/Support**:  
   - Add a section addressing common queries (e.g., "How to resubmit?").  
   - Include contact details for REC support.  

5. **Notifications**:
