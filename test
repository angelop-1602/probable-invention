### **Review Document Fields**
1. **reviewerCode**: string  
   *Unique identifier for the reviewer (e.g., XXXX-001).*

2. **reviewerName**: string  
   *Name of the reviewer (e.g., "Dr. Jane Smith").*

3. **assignedForm**: string  
   *Form type used (e.g., "Form 06A", "Form 06B", "Form 04A", "Form 06C").*

4. **reviewType**: string  
   *Stage of review: `Initial`, `Resubmission`, or `Termination`.*

5. **submittedDocuments**: array  
   *List of document references or filenames reviewed (e.g., ["Protocol_v2.pdf", "ConsentForm.docx"]).*

6. **decision**: string  
   *Outcome: `Approved`, `Minor Modifications Required`, `Major Modifications Required`, `Disapproved`.*

7. **decisionJustification**: string  
   *Detailed justification for the decision (from the form's "Justification for the Recommendation" section).*

8. **reviewDate**: timestamp  
   *Date and time when the review was completed.*

9. **formResponses**: map  
   *Structured responses to the formâ€™s questions. Each key is a question identifier (e.g., "1", "2.1", "3.5"), and the value is an object with:*  
   - **answer**: string (`Yes`, `No`, `Unable to assess`, or custom responses like `Anonymized`).  
   - **comment**: string (*Optional remarks from the reviewer for that question*).

   Example:  
   ```json
   "formResponses": {
     "1": {
       "answer": "Yes",
       "comment": "The study addresses a critical public health gap."
     },
     "2.1": {
       "answer": "No",
       "comment": "Objectives lack clarity."
     }
   }
   ```

10. **generalComments**: string  
    *Overall comments from the reviewer (e.g., "Requires revisions to Section 3").*

---

### **Enhancements Added**  
- **Decision Justification**: Separated from general comments to align with form requirements.  
- **Form-Specific Responses**: Structured storage of answers and comments for each question (supports all form types).  
- **Clarity**: Renamed `comments` to `generalComments` to avoid confusion with per-question comments in `formResponses`.

---

### **Use Case Example**  
For a review using **Form 06A** (Protocol Review):  
- `formResponses` captures answers to questions like *SOCIAL VALUE*, *SCIENTIFIC SOUNDNESS*, etc.  
- `decisionJustification` includes the rationale for approval/modifications.  

For **Form 06C** (Informed Consent):  
- `formResponses` stores answers to all 17 guide questions (e.g., consent clarity, privacy safeguards).  

---

### **Why This Works**  
- **Flexibility**: Handles all form types (06A, 06B, 04A, 06C) with dynamic question storage.  
- **Query Efficiency**: Retrieve specific question answers using keys (e.g., `formResponses.3.1.answer`).  
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new forms without schema changes.
